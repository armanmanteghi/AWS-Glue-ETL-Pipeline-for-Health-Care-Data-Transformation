# AWS-Glue-ETL-Pipeline-for-Health-Care-Data-Transformation
This repository contains an AWS Glue ETL pipeline designed to transform health care data from a raw format in Amazon S3. The pipeline standardizes, normalizes, and cleans the data to make it suitable for analysis and reporting. The transformed data is then saved back to S3 for further exploration and visualization.
